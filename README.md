# Fluent Bit and Ingress Demo with Kind

## What the Script Does

This script creates a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind, installs Fluent Bit for log collection, and sets up ingress-nginx to expose a demo app. It ensures control plane pods are excluded from logging, waits for the app to become available, and deletes the cluster when the script exits.

## Requirements

* Docker
* Kind
* kubectl
* Helm

Files needed in the same directory:

* `kind.yaml`
* `fb.yaml`
* `nginx-values.yaml`
* `demo-app.yaml`
* `demo-ingress.yaml`

## Quick Start

```bash
brew install kind kubectl helm
```

```bash
./script.sh
```

## Example Output

```

The script sets up everything, checks that the app is responding, then tails logs from Fluent Bit. The Kind cluster and context is removed automatically when the script ends. (Ctrl+C)

This script was used in testing fluentbits nginx paser.

You can curl the localhost endpoint to generate logs.
```bash
curl -sv http://localhost/
